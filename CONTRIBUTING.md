Contributing to Superconductor
==============================

We kindly welcome all contributors to Superconductor. If you simply want to report a bug, do so at our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Superconductor/superconductor/issues). If you want to contribute code, read on.

We follow the [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) model of version control. In brief: 

1. The master branch is always kept in full working order, including demos.
2. To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie: new-oauth2-scopes)
3. Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
4. When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
5. Each branch **must** be signed off on by at least one other member of the Superconductor team before being merged into master, no exceptions. You can make use of @username formatting in pull requests to ping a team member.
6. After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master
7. Once it is merged and pushed to ‘master’, you can and should deploy immediately

Happy committing!
