		<p>If you want to get started viewing or creating Superconductor visualizations, you're in the right place. The instructions below will walk you through downloading and installing Superconductor for yourself.</p>
		
				
		<div class="section">
			<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
			<p>The developer preview of Superconductor currently only supports the following platform:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An Apple laptop/desktop computer</li>
				<li>Mac OS X 10.8 ('Mountain Lion') or newer</li>
				<li>An NVIDIA (preferred) or ATI graphics chip available in your computer</l1>
			</ul>
			<p>Support for more platforms is a high priority, and we're working hard to add that to Superconductor.</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<div class="section">
			<h2 id="downloading">Downloading</h2>
			
			<p>The Superconductor code includes everything you need to create your own visualizations. If you just want to view visualizations, it's not strictly necessary. However, it does include a number of demo visualizations to try out.</p>
			
			<p>The best way to obtain a copy of the code is to clone our our <a href="https://github.com/Superconductor/superconductor">GitHub repo</a>. This will give you the latest copy of Superconductor, and allow you to keep up to date with a <code>git pull</code>.</p>
			
			<p>You can also download a snapshot of the latest version of our code from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Superconductor/superconductor/archive/master.zip">here</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="viewing">Viewing Visualizations</h2>
			<p>Underneath the hood, Superconductor uses the power of <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webcl/">WebCL</a> and <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a> to unleash your GPU to run big, interactive visualizations. <strong>To view Superconductor visualizations, you'll need a web browser which supports both together.</strong></p>
			
			<p>At present, WebCL is right on the bleeding edge of web standards, and so <strong>the only browser we are aware of that supports both WebCL and WebGL together is Samsung's version of WebKit</strong><!-- <sup><a id="footnote-browsers-origin" href="#footnote-browsers">1</a></sup> -->. As WebCL matures, we hope to see wider browser support. We are also actively working on alternatives for when WebCL isn't available.</p>
			
			<p>To get and run WebKit-WebCL:
				<ol>
					<li>Be sure you have <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action">Command Line Tools for XCode</a>.</li>
					<li>Clone Samsung's <a href="https://github.com/SRA-SiliconValley/webkit-webcl">WebKit-WebCL GitHub repo</a>.</li>
					<li>In a Terminal window, <code>cd</code> to the root of the cloned repo and run <code>./Tools/Scripts/build-webkit</code>,</li>
					<li>Run the WebCL-enabled version of Safari with <code>./Tools/Scripts/run-safari</code></li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p class=""><span class="label label-warning">Warning</span> You will need to run the <code>run-safari</code> script from WebKit-WebCL every time you want to launch WebCL-enabled Safari. Running Safari without using the script will launch the normal version of Safari, without WebCL support.</p>
				
			<p>You can test WebCL is enabled by opening the <code>./Examples/WebCL/Hello/index.html</code> page included in WebKit-WebCL; you should see a message like "Computed 1014/1024 correct values" (it's OK if not all values were correct in this demo.)</p>

			<!-- <small class="footnote" id="footnote-browsers"><sup><a href="#footnote-browsers-origin">1</a></sup>Nokia has <a href="http://webcl.nokiaresearch.com/">an implementation of WebCL for Firefox</a>, and while it supports both WebCL and WebGL, it does not support interaction between them, and so does not work with Superconductor.</small> -->
